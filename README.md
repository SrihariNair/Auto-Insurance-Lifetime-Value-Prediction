Overview
The "AutoInsure Lifetime Value Prediction" project is designed to estimate the lifetime value of car insurance customers using various predictive modeling techniques. This project encompasses a thorough analysis and application of multiple machine learning models to predict customer lifetime value (CLV), which is critical for optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer relationship management in the insurance sector.

Models Used
Linear Regression: Serves as the baseline for performance comparison.
Neural Networks: Explores complex nonlinear relationships through deep learning.
Random Forest: Leverages an ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
XGBoost: Utilizes gradient boosting frameworks for efficient and effective learning.
